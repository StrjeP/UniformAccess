# Idiom F: Claims and Assertions

Following on from Identity, the idea that an identity can be qualified to specify additional details
which help to improve the understanding of the specific identity. This can be generalized to the idea
of claims and assertions.

If a file is generated from a dataset, for a specific date range and a fixed set of products. The 
file could make assertions that it was from a specific data source, and contains data covering a
date range and specific set of products. This is coverage on the date dimension and a set of
values on the product dimension. It also could make assertions of the algorithm used to generate 
the average and the specific hardware used.

There is another dimension to claims and assertions, that is Information Assurance, the security, 
the dependability and the reproducibility (I've added reproducibility as seems sensible in the
modern distributed world). With care it is possible to create an evidence based providence chain. 
Allowing the claims to provide details of how to locate evidence to prove the information is 
complete, correct and reproducible.
